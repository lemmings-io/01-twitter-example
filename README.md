# Twitter Example

A Twitter bot example in Clojure

## Step-by-step Tutorial

1. Make sure you have followed the [Lemmings Clojure and Atom Editor setup](https://lemmings.io/clojure-and-atom-editor-setup-40f8f09237b4).

2. Start a new vagrant session by opening a new [terminal](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) window (on Windows you can use [Git BASH](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)), navigate to the 'clojure-master' directory you downloaded [before](https://github.com/lemmings-io/clojure) which contains the 'Vagrantfile' and run `vagrant ssh`.

3. In the VM, change into the projects directory with `cd projects/` and start with the tutorial.

    ![cd projects](doc/images/cd-projects.png)

4. "Clone" the Twitter example into your Vagrant environment

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/lemmings-io/01-twitter-example.git
    ```

    Now change into the twitter example directory:

    ```shell
    cd 01-twitter-example
    ```

    ![cd twitter-example](doc/images/cd-twitter-example.png)

5. Start the nREPL server

    Start another VM session by opening a new terminal window (Cmd-T) and run `vagrant ssh`.

    Navigate to the project folder you just created with `cd projects/01-twitter-example`.

    Start the nREPL server with `lein repl :headless :host 0.0.0.0 :port 7888` as described in the [Clojure and Atom Editor Setup](https://lemmings.io/clojure-and-atom-editor-setup-40f8f09237b4)

   ![run nREPL server](doc/images/nrepl-server.png)

6. Open your project in Atom.

   Start Atom and open the folder `clojure-master/projects/01-twitter-example`
   as an Atom project.

   There's two things to know about Atom:

   1. Ctrl-P on Windows and Cmd-P on macOS opens a file search. You can use
   this to jump to any file in your project quickly.

   2. Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows and Cmd-Shift-P on macOS opens the
   Atom Command Palette. You use it to start the nREPL or enable Autoeval.

6. Connect to Atom's nREPL.

    Look at the [Lemmings Clojure guide](https://lemmings.io/clojure-and-atom-editor-setup-40f8f09237b4)
    for detailled instructions.

7. Turn on the "Autoeval" feature of Proto Repl:

    Open the `core.clj` file in Atom, then open Atom command palette and search
    for "Proto Repl: Autoeval file" and press return.

    *Hint*: You can find the `core.clj` file in `src/twitter_example/core.clj`,
    but if you press Ctrl-P on Windows or Cmd-P on macOS you can easily search
    through all files in your project.

    This feature will take care to synchronize your code in the `core.clj` file
    with the Clojure REPL.

8. **Artistic Tweaking**

    You can see the lemmings bot in action [here](https://twitter.com/betalemming).

    However, you probably want to personalise your tweets now :)

    In your `core.clj` you'll find two lists: `templates` (the skeleton of your tweets) and `blanks` (the strings you'll fill the blanks with). You can replace these strings with your own, just remember to keep the `___`.

    You can test the generated sentences in your REPL following these steps:

    - Run `(ns twitter-example.core)` to initialize your app's namespace in the nREPL.

        ![repl-ns](doc/images/repl-ns.png)

    - Run `(generate-sentence)`.

    - Be amazed by your bot's creativity!

9. Let's bring it to life! Provide your Twitter API tokens for local development by creating a file called `profiles.clj` in `01-twitter-example` with Atom.

    You can find instructions for signing up for Twitter and getting these tokens in the [Twitter Bot example](http://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1/) in the section *Hooking the bot up to Twitter*.

    ```clojure
    {:dev {:env {:app-consumer-key "<REPLACE>"
                 :app-consumer-secret "<REPLACE>"
                 :user-access-token "<REPLACE>"
                 :user-access-secret "<REPLACE>"}}}
    ```
    ![profiles.clj](doc/images/profiles-clj.png)

4. Test if your bot tweets in Atom's nREPL

    Run `(ns twitter-example.core)` to initialize your app's namespace in the nREPL.

    Then run `(tweet-sentence)` in the nREPL to send a status update through your twitter account.

    ![tweet via repl](doc/images/tweet-via-repl.png)
    ![twitter tweet](doc/images/twitter-tweet.png)

3. Start the twitter bot inside Vagrant:

    In the Terminal where you are connected to Vagrant (`vagrant ssh`) run `lein trampoline run` to start a Clojure system that will tweet every 2 hours.
